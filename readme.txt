This is a self-contained php application to display scanned images of
the Westergaard DhatuPatha.

When installed (as folder Westergaard) in the php htdocs location,
the relative url is Westergaard/disp/index.php.

index.php also responds to parameter '?section=X', where XX = 1 to 36

In the Monier-Williams displays, such as 
//www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc1/index.php,
there is a linkage to this display for roots (such as yA, su, etc.).
