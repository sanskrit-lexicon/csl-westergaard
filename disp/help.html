<h2>Westergaard Dhatupatha    </h2>
<p>The original source of the images for Westergaard's Dhatupatha was from the scanned edition at <a href='//www.archive.org/'>Internet Archive</a> of <em>Radices Linguae Sanscritae</em> by N.L. Westergaard (1841). Only the Dhatupatha portion of Westergaard's book is included in the display. The format of the
images in 'radiceslinguaesa00westuoft_jp2.zip' has been adjusted to a 
smaller black and white 'jpg' format.
